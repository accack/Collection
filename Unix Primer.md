###Directories
File and directory paths in UNIX use the forward slash `/` to separate directory names in a path.

Examples|Description
-------|-----------
`/`|"Root" directory
`/usr`|Directory `usr` (sub-directory of `/`).
`/usr/STRIM100`|`STRIM100` is a subdirectory of `/usr`.

###Moving Around The File System

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`pwd`|Show the "present working directory", or current directory.
`cd`|Change current directory to your HOME directory.
`cd /usr/STRIM100`|Change current directory to `/usr/STRIM100`.
`cd INIT`|Change current directory to INIT which is a sub-directory of the current directory.
`cd ..`|Change current directory to the parent directory of the current directory.
`cd $STRMWORK`|Change current directory to the directory defined by the environment variable `STRMWORK`.
`cd ~bob`|Change the current directory to the user bob's home directory (if you have permission).

###Listing Directory Contents

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`ls`|List a directory
`ls -l`|List a directory in long (detailed) format
`ls -a`|List the current directory including hidden files. Hidden files start with "." 
`ls -ld *`|List all the file and directory names in the current directory using long format. Without the "d" option, ls would list the contents of any sub-directory of the current. With the "d" option, ls just lists them like regular files. 

#####The`ls -l` output layout
````
$ ls -l 
drwxr-xr-x    4 cliff    user        1024 Jun 18 09:40 WAITRON_EARNINGS
-rw-r--r--    1 cliff    user      767392 Jun  6 14:28 scanlib.tar.gz
^ ^  ^  ^     ^   ^       ^           ^      ^    ^      ^
| |  |  |     |   |       |           |      |    |      |  
| |  |  |     | owner   group       size   date  time    name 
| |  |  |     number of links to file or directory contents
| |  |  permissions for world
| |  permissions for members of group
| permissions for owner of file: r = read, w = write, x = execute -=no permission
type of file: - = normal file, d=directory, l = symbolic link, and others...
````

###Changing File Permissions And Attributes

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`chmod 755 file`|Changes the permissions of file to be rwx for the owner, and rx for the group and the world.<br>*7 = rwx (111 binary); 5 = r-x (101 binary)*
`chgrp user file`|Makes file belong to the group user.
`chown cliff file`|Makes cliff the owner of file.
`chown -R cliff dir`|Makes cliff the owner of dir and everything in its directory tree. 

You must be the owner of the file/directory or be root before you can do any of these things. 

###Moving, Renaming, And Copying Files

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`cp file1 file2`|copy a file
`mv file1 newname`|move or rename a file
`mv file1 ~/AAA/`|move file1 into sub-directory AAA in your home directory.
`rm file1 [file2 ...]`|remove or delete a file
`rm -r dir1 [dir2...]`|recursivly remove a directory and its contents BE CAREFUL!
`mkdir dir1 [dir2...]`|create directories
`mkdir -p dirpath`|create the directory dirpath, including all implied directories in the path.
`rmdir dir1 [dir2...]`|remove an empty directory

###Viewing And Editing Files

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`cat filename`|Dump a file to the screen in ascii. 
`more filename`|Progressively dump a file to the screen: <br>ENTER = one line down; SPACEBAR = page down; q=quit
`less filename`|Like more, but you can use Page-Up too. Not on all systems. 
`vi filename`|Edit a file using the vi editor. All UNIX systems will have vi in some form. 
`emacs filename`|Edit a file using the emacs editor. Not all systems will have emacs. 
`head filename`|Show the first few lines of a file.
`head -n  filename`|Show the first n lines of a file.
`tail filename`|Show the last few lines of a file.
`tail -n filename`|Show the last n lines of a file.

###Shells 
The behavior of the command line interface will differ slightly depending on the shell program that is being used - some extra behaviors can be quite nifty.

You can find out what shell you are using by the command `echo $SHELL`.

Of course you can create a file with a list of shell commands and execute it like a program to perform a task. This is called a shell script. This is in fact the primary purpose of most shells, not the interactive command line behavior. 

###Environment Variables
You can teach your shell to remember things for later using environment variables.
For example under the bash shell:

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`export CASROOT=/usr/local/CAS3.0`|Defines the variable `CASROOT` with the value `/usr/local/CAS3.0`.
`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CASROOT/Linux/lib`|Defines the variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with the value of `CASROOT` with `/Linux/lib` appended, or `/usr/local/CAS3.0/Linux/lib`

By prefixing $ to the variable name, you can evaluate it in any command:

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`cd $CASROOT`|Changes your present working directory to the value of `CASROOT`
`echo $CASROOT`|Prints out the value of `CASROOT`, or `/usr/local/CAS3.0`
`printenv CASROOT`|Does the same thing in bash and some other shells. 

###Previous Commands
A feature of most terminal-type editors is that you can use the up-arrow keys to access your previous commands, edit them, and re-execute them.

###Tab Completion
Another feature of many editors is that you can use the TAB key to complete a partially typed filename. For example if you have a file called`constantine-monks-and-willy-wonka.txt` in your directory and want to edit it you can type`vi const`, hit the TAB key, and the shell will fill in the rest of the name for you (provided the completion is unique). Bash will even complete the name of commands and environment variables.

If there are multiple completions, if you hit TAB twice your terminal will probably show you all the completions. 

###Redirection
Command|Description
-------|-----------
`grep string filename > newfile`|Redirects the output of the above grep command to a file 'newfile'.
`grep string filename >> existfile`|Appends the output of the grep command to the end of 'existfile'.

The redirection directives, `>` and `>>` can be used on the output of most commands 
to direct their output to a file.

###Pipes
The pipe symbol "&#124;" is used to direct the output of one command to the input of another.

Example|Description
-------|-----------
`ls -l `&#124;` more`|This commands takes the output of the long format directory list command `ls -l` and pipes it through the more command (also known as a filter). In this case a very long list of files can be viewed a page at a time.
`du -sc * `&#124;` sort -n `&#124;` tail`|The command `du -sc` lists the sizes of all files and directories in the current working directory. That is piped through `sort -n` which orders the output from smallest to largest size. Finally, that output is piped through `tail` which displays only the last few (which just happen to be the largest) results.

###Command Substitution
You can use the output of one command as an input to another command in another way called command substitution. Command substitution is invoked when by enclosing the substituted command in backwards single quotes. For example `cat 'find . -name aaa.txt'` which will cat (dump to the screen) all the files named aaa.txt that exist in the current directory or in any subdirectory tree. 

### Searching For Strings In Files
#####The `grep` Command

Example|Description
-------|-----------
`grep string filename`|Prints all the lines in a file that contain the string

###Searching For Files
#####The `find` Command

Example|Description
-------|-----------
`find search_path -name filename`|
`find . -name aaa.txt`|Finds all the files named aaa.txt in the current directory or any subdirectory tree. 
`find / -name vimrc`|Find all the files named 'vimrc' anywhere on the system. 
`find /usr/local/games -name "*xpilot*"`|Find all files whose names contain the string 'xpilot' which exist within the '/usr/local/games' directory tree. 

###Reading and writing tapes, backups, and archives
#####The `tar` Command  
The tar command stands for "tape archive". It is the "standard" way to read and write archives (collections of files and whole directory trees).

Often you will find archives of stuff with names like stuff.tar, or stuff.tar.gz.  This is stuff in a tar archive, and stuff in a tar archive which has been compressed using thegzip compression program respectivly. 

Chances are that if someone gives you a tape written on a UNIX system, it will be in tar format, and you will use tar (and your tape drive) to read it. 

Likewise, if you want to write a tape to give to someone else, you should probably use tar as well. 

Example|Description
-------|-----------
`tar xv`|Extracts (x) files from the default tape drive while listing (v = verbose) the file names to the screen.
`tar tv`|Lists the files from the default tape device without extracting them. 
`tar cv file1 file2`|Write files `file1` and `file2` to the default tape device.
`tar cvf archive.tar file1 [file2...]`|Create a tar archive as a file `archive.tar` containing file1, file2...etc.
`tar xvf archive.tar`|Extract from the archive file.
`tar cvfz archive.tar.gz dname`|Create a gzip compressed tar archive containing everything in the directory 'dname'. This does not work with all versions of tar.
`tar xvfz archive.tar.gz`|Extract a gzip compressed tar archive.  Does not work with all versions of tar. 
`tar cvfI archive.tar.bz2 dname`|Create a bz2 compressed tar archive. Does not work with all versions of tar.

###File Compression
#####compress, gzip, and bzip2

The standard UNIX compression commands are compress and uncompress. Compressed files have a suffix `.Z` added to their name. 

Example|Description
-------|-----------
`compress part.igs`|Creates a compressed file `part.igs.Z`.
`uncompress part.igs`|Uncompresseis `part.igs` from the compressed file `part.igs.Z`. Note the `.Z` is not required.

Another common compression utility is **gzip** (and **gunzip**). These are the GNU compress and uncompress utilities. gzip usually gives better compression than standard compress, but may not be installed on all systems. The suffix for gzipped files is `.gz`.

Example|Description
-------|-----------
`gzip part.igs`|Creates a compressed file `part.igs.gz`.
`gunzip part.igs`|Extracts the original file from `part.igs.gz`.

The **bzip2** utility has (in general) even better compression than gzip, but at the cost of longer times to compress and uncompress the files. It is not as common a utility as gzip, but is becoming more generally available. 

Example|Description
-------|-----------
`bzip2 part.igs`|Create a compressed Iges file `part.igs.bz2`.
`bunzip2 part.igs.bz2`|Uncompress the compressed iges file. 

###Looking For Help
#####The `man` and `apropos` Commands
Most of the commands have a manual page which give sometimes useful, often more or less detailed, sometimes cryptic and unfathomable discriptions of their usage. Some say they are called man pages because they are only for real men. 

Example|Description
-------|-----------
`man ls`|Shows the manual page for the `ls` command

You can search through the man pages using `apropos`

Example|Description
-------|-----------
`apropos build`|Shows a list of all the man pages whose descriptions contain the word "build"

Do a `man apropos` for detailed help on `apropos`.

###Basics Of The vi Editor

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`vi filename`|Opening a file

####Creating text 
These keys enter editing modes and type in the text of your document. 

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`i`|Insert before current cursor position
`I`|Insert at beginning of current line
`a`|Insert (append) after current cursor position
`A`|Append to end of line
`r`|Replace 1 character
`R`|Replace mode
`<ESC>`|Terminate insertion or overwrite mode

####Deletion of text

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`x`|Delete single character
`dd`|Delete current line and put in buffer
`ndd`|Delete n lines (n is a number) and put them in buffer
`J`|Attaches the next line to the end of the current line (deletes carriage return).

#### Oops

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`u`|Undo last command

####Cut And Paste

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`yy`|Yank current line into buffer
`nyy`|Yank n lines into buffer
`p`|Put the contents of the buffer after the current line
`P`|Put the contents of the buffer before the current line

####Cursor Positioning

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`^d`|Page down
`^u`|Page up
`:n`|Position cursor at line n
`:$`|Position cursor at end of file
`^g`|Display current line number
`h,j,k,l`|Left,Down,Up, and Right respectivly. Your arrow keys should also work if your keyboard mappings are anywhere near sane.

####String Substitution

Example|Description
-------|-----------
`:n1,n2:s/string1/string2/[g]`|Substitute string2 for string1 on lines n1 to n2. If g is included (meaning global),   all instances of string1 on each line are substituted. If g is not included, only the first instance per matching line is substituted.

`^` matches start of line
`.` matches any single character
`$` matches end of line

These and other "special characters" (like the forward slash) can be "escaped" with \, i.e to match the string`"/usr/STRIM100/SOFT"` say`"\/usr\/STRIM100\/SOFT"` 

Example|Description
-------|-----------
`:1,$:s/dog/cat/g`|Substitute 'cat' for 'dog', every instance for the entire file - lines 1 to $ (end of file)
`:23,25:/frog/bird/`|Substitute 'bird' for 'frog' on lines 23 through 25. Only the first instance  on each line is substituted.

####Saving and Quitting and Other "ex" Commands

These commands are all prefixed by pressing colon (:) and then entered in the lower left corner of the window. They are called "ex" commands because they are commands of the ex text editor - the precursor line editor to the screen editor vi. You cannot enter an "ex" command when you are in an edit mode (typing text onto the screen).

Press <ESC> to exit from an editing mode.

Command|Description
-------|-----------
`:w`|Write the current file.
`:w new.file`|Write the file to the name 'new.file'.
`:w! existing.file`|Overwrite an existing file with the file currently being edited. 
`:wq`|Write the file and quit.
`:q`|Quit.
`:q!`|Quit with no changes.
`:e filename`|Open the file 'filename' for editing.
`:set number`|Turns on line numbering
`:set nonumber`|Turns off line numbering
